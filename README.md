### Introduction

Have you ever been in a situation where many players need help, but there are only one or two admins online? It can be difficult to keep track of who needs help and in what order they asked for it. What if hardworking players who get promoted to admin start slacking off and not helping anymore? This plugin aims to solve both of these problems by introducing motivating incentives for your team and re-consolidating player-staff interaction.

[First released](https://dev.bukkit.org/bukkit-plugins/admin360/) by Vidhu in 2013, Admin360 is a lightweight yet a very essential community relations tool for Minecraft communities of any size. The new version revives this inactive plugin with several new features, bug fixes and QoL changes to its 2013 base, resulting in better performance, forward compatibility and customizability.
