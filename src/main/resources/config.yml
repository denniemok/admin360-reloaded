# Admin360 auto-renames any old config file into "config_old.yml" on server restart.
# You should delete "config_old.yml" after use to avoid breaking auto-renaming on future updates.

# Comments in this file can be a bit lengthy because we try hard to explain everything to you.
# If you do spend time reading through all the messages, I assure you a good understanding of how Admin360 works.

# This plugin supports HEX codes on 1.16+ servers.
# Example: "#e69296This is a #c8a2c8test #e69296message."

# All messages, by default, contain all the built-in placeholders made available to that particular message.
# You can safely remove or duplicate these placeholders in a message.

# Admin360 recognises players with permission "admin360.staff.basic" as staff on server join.
# If a player is granted the above permission while they're online, they should re-join the server.

# <PENDING> <ATTENDING> <COMPLETING> <COMPLETED> are the 4 major stages Admin360 used to administer Requests.
# The first 3 stages are managed completely in Memory, while completed requests will be saved to the database.

# <PENDING> is a Queue holding all pending Requests that awaits processing.
# <ATTENDING> is a List holding all attending Requests that are currently in progress.
# <COMPLETING> is a List holding all closed Requests that awaits user review.
# <COMPLETED> does not exist in Memory, but all entries in the database can be referred to this stage.

# What Admin360 does is to manage the transition between these stages.
# Incomplete requests will be voided on server restart.
